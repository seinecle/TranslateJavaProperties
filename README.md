# Translate a language bundle in target languages

Pretty nice: translate a bundle of language properties in dozens of target languages in a few minutes!

The names of your language bundle properties are assumed to be in the form of "text_en.properties"

English (en) is assumed to be the source language. Easy to change in the code.

For Google Translate, you are supposed to have configured your Google Cloud console to create a service, enabled the translation API *and* to have enabled payments on your account.

For DeepL, a simple API key needs to be created (it is free).

Both Google Translate and DeepL have a free tiers of 500,000 characters to translate per month (as of April 2022 at least).
